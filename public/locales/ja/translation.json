As yield is generated through a pool’s strategy and top up fees, the pool’s LP token appreciates, distributing the earnings to the pool’s liquidity providers. Similar to collateral top ups, yield farming strategies are subject to a performance fee, which is split between their creator (i.e. the strategist) and a reserve fund."

The protocol offers a lot of room for parameterization, such as required reserve ratios for pools, strategy allocation weights, reserve requirement weights for vaults or LP and keeper fees. Furthermore, new pools, strategies and supported protocols can be added via governance."

    "introduction": {
      "header": "Introduction",
      "paragraph1": "Backd is an Ethereum based protocol designed to increase the capital efficiency of borrowing assets in DeFi. Unlike other DeFi protocols, Backd liquidity pools react to market conditions and users’ needs. In other words, users can optimize their debt positions by depositing assets into Backd pools which are then automatically deployed to where they are the most efficient.",
      "paragraph2": "The Backd protocol solves the problem borrowers of over-collateralized loans in DeFi are faced with: the higher the amount of excess collateral posted, the higher the opportunity cost of not being able to earn interest on these funds elsewhere. At the same time, low collateral-to-debt ratios result in higher liquidation risk to the borrower. Hence, borrowers are left with the non-trivial and potentially very costly challenge of manually allocating deposits across protocols, optimizing for high interest and low liquidation risk.",
      "paragraph3": "A solution is offered by Backd, which introduces the concept of reactive liquidity, whereby deposits are automatically shifted between protocols depending on the state of over-collateralized loans and the profitability of yield generating opportunities. More specifically, a liquidity provider (LP) on Backd is able to register deposits as “backup collateral”. Thereby the deposited funds can earn interest through yield farming strategies until needed to increase the user’s collateral-to-debt ratio on different protocols during times of market volatility."
    },
    "keepers": {
      "header": "Backd Keepers",
      "paragraph": "Keepers are an integral part of Backd’s collateral top up mechanism. A keeper is an off-chain bot that monitors Backd top up registrations and reports eligible collateral top ups to the Backd smart contract. The Backd smart contract handles users’ funds and executes top ups by injecting capital into registered collateral. Keepers collect a percentage of the generated top up fee every time they report an eligible top up. In addition to this, keepers are also distributed Backd rewards in proportion to the top up value they have executed.  Anyone can operate an off-chain keeper bot for Backd."

          "header": "Assets:"
        },
        "parameterization": {
          "description": "Pools are very customizable. For instance, each pool has a required reserve ratio, which specifies the percentage of the backing funds that need to remain idle in the pool, i.e., funds which cannot be allocated to strategies but are reserved solely for the purpose of top ups. Intuitively, a lower reserve ratio comes with higher expected earnings (as more funds are allocated to a strategy), at the cost of increased insolvency risk, i.e., insufficient funds available for top up.  Furthermore, pools can differ in terms of fees charged on top ups and strategy performance.",

      "header": "Liquidity Pools",
      "paragraph1": "Through the combination of collateral top ups and yield-farming strategies, Backd enables novel multi-utility liquidity pools. This empowers borrowers to increase the capital efficiency of their positions while better managing liquidation risk. Backd achieves this through the administration of single-asset liquidity pools. Users who deposit funds into a pool (liquidity providers) receive Backd LP tokens which can be registered for collateral top ups (liquidation protection) and staked to earn further rewards. Furthermore, as collateral top ups occur, LPs receive a share of the collateral top up fees, in addition to any net profits harvested from a pool’s strategy.",
      "paragraph2": "Liquidity pools function in isolation from one another with each asset having its own pool.  Backd will launch with liquidity pools for DAI, USDC, and ETH. In order to ensure that a sufficient amount of the underlying asset is available for collateral top ups, each pool maintains a required reserve ratio. This ratio defines the percentage of total pool assets which cannot be utilized by yield farming strategies and remain idle at all times. This allows the protocol to invariably execute collateral top ups, while reducing the transaction cost of withdrawals (including top ups).",

Top up registration is personalized to the user by allowing individuals to select the parameters that best serve their borrow positions and risk tolerance. The parameters required to register a top up position are:",
      "paragraph2": "Once registered, the user will continue to earn yield on the registered funds until a collateral top up is triggered. A collateral top up refers to using funds to increase the collateral for a particular borrow position. When this occurs, liquidity is shifted from Backd to the respective protocol, the collateralization ratio of the topped up position increases, and in turn mitigates liquidation risk. Collateral top up eligibility is determined by the health factor of registered positions and is reported by Backd keepers.",
