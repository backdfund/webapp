    "introduction": {
      "header": "Introduction",
      "paragraph1": " <0>Mero</0> is a trustless and interest generating protocol that automates asset efficiency through yield aggregation and customizable liquidity delegation. The Mero protocolâ€™s reactive liquidity pools empower DeFi users through the realization of greater asset utility, efficient aggregation of yield, and mitigation of opportunity cost."
    },
    "capitalEfficiency": {
      "header": "Capital efficiency in DeFi today",
      "paragraph1": "In the traditional finance (TradFi) world capital efficiency is the ratio of how much a company is spending on growing revenue and how much they are getting in return. Something that requires low capital but generates high returns is considered to be highly capital efficient.",
      "paragraph2": "In DeFi capital efficiency has become somewhat of an ironic term. The term is often overused and while DeFi claims to be capital efficient, it often isnâ€™t.",
      "notEfficient": {
        "header": "Why isnâ€™t DeFi capital efficient?",
        "paragraph1": "DeFi protocols today generally focus on fulfilling one specific function. This may include borrowing and lending, market orders, yield aggregation, etc. While many protocols fulfill specific needs in a capital efficient way, the broader DeFi ecosystem is left inefficient.",
        "paragraph2": "This is because DeFi today is bounded by static or single-utility liquidity pools. Meaning, liquidity must be dedicated to only serving one function at a time. Every time a user deposits assets into a protocol they realize the opportunity cost of not having their assets allocated elsewhere. This is one of the reasons why yield aggregating protocols do not capture more Total Value Locked (TVL). Every dollar increase in provided liquidity results in an increased realized opportunity cost.",
        "paragraph3": "Individuals often make the argument that if your assets are not earning yield you are losing money. While this statement might be true if the alternative is holding cash in a TradFi savings account, it is a fallacy when applied to DeFi. Deploying your assets to a yield farming protocol might actually result in a loss when compared to market returns. The correct argument is that if your assets are not earning yield at the right time you are losing money."
      },
      "earnYield": {
        "header": "Earning yield at the right time",
        "paragraph1": "Generally the correct time to deploy your assets to earn yield is during periods of high volatility (trading fees) or high demand for leverage (lending rates). However, there is no generic or universal formula for when to provide liquidity in a yield farming protocol. This is because every DeFi user has their own unique strategy which comes with specific needs.",
        "paragraph2": "To this date, DeFi users have had to manually shift their liquidity between earning yield and other positions in order to stay efficient. This has placed somewhat of an efficiency ceiling on DeFi users. The rapidly evolving and highly volatile nature of crypto makes maintaining capital efficiency through manually delegating liquidity virtually impossible."
      }
    },
    "reactiveLiquidity": {
      "header": "Reactive liquidity",
      "paragraph1": "Mero eliminates this aforementioned capital inefficiency through the deployment of novel multi-utility liquidity pools. Until now, yield farming protocols have focused on solving opportunity cost by trying to increase yield. However yield is not a solution to opportunity cost, it is compensation.",
      "paragraph2": "Mero effectively mitigates opportunity cost and thus increases capital efficiency by changing the nature or utility of provided liquidity itself. Unlike normal yield-farming protocols, where provided liquidity will remain static until the user withdraws it, liquidity deposited into Mero can autonomously react to market conditions or user defined variables. Specifically, users can add customizable actions to their provided liquidity. Adding an action allows users to earn yield until their assets are more efficient elsewhere. At which point, the Mero protocol will automatically delegate your liquidity to where it is needed.",
      "paragraph3": "Mero generates yield from both yield-farming strategies and actions. Every time an action occurs on Mero, a small action fee is charged and paid out to Mero liquidity providers. It is important to note that registering an action to your Mero liquidity is optional. Actions are solely an additional utility layer, empowering liquidity providers to do more with their deposits. Because Mero is able to capture yield beyond strategy profits, it can be an optimal option for users only looking to farm yield and not to make their liquidity reactive."
    },
    "action": {
      "header": "Action 01: Collateral Top-ups",
      "paragraph1": "The first action that Mero will support, which will be available at launch, is collateral top ups. Support for more actions will be added in the future. The core protocol architecture of Mero is designed in a way that makes adding new actions, strategies, or supported protocols (for actions) easy. This allows Mero to perpetually increase yield and utility for LPs as DeFi evolves.",
      "what": {
        "header": "What is a Collateral Top-up?",
        "paragraph1": "A top-up is the act of depositing additional collateral in order to increase the health factor of your loan or mitigate liquidation risk. Mero liquidity providers can use their Mero LP tokens to register Collateral Top-up Positions. This creates back up collateral or what you could call interest earning liquidation protection. When a user registers a Collateral Top-up Position they must specify how much of their Mero liquidity should be shifted and at what health factor a top-up should occur. After registering a Collateral Top-up Position the Mero userâ€™s liquidity will continue to be allocated to yield-farming strategies until it is needed.",
        "paragraph2": "Meroâ€™s Collateral Top-up Position increase collateral efficiency by enabling any borrower on supported protocols (Mero will support Aave v2 & Compound loans at launch) to earn yield with their collateral. Furthermore this also enables borrowers to increase leverage by depositing less collateral and hedge liquidation risk by automatically posting extra collateral when needed.",
        "paragraph3": "Mero creates an infrastructure that enables the combination of on-chain actions, off-chain keepers that react to market events, and yield-farming. This unique combination lends itself to a multitude of actions and integration with many protocols. Mero not only makes liquidity more efficient, but also makes other protocols safer and smarter."
      }
    },
    "fees": {
      "header": "Platform fees",
      "paragraph1": "The protocol architecture that facilitates Meroâ€™s reactive liquidity creates the framework for a fee generating powerhouse. The Mero protocols platform fees can be broken up into two main categories (actions and strategies).",
      "action": {
        "header": "Action fees",
        "paragraph1": "Every time an action is executed, a fee is collected in the form of LP tokens. Part of that fee is sent directly to liquidity providers which in turn compounds yield, while a portion is paid to the keeper that executes an action. Action fees create yield diversified from traditional strategies. For example, Mero collateral top up fees will generate higher returns during periods of market volatility (because more loans will need to be topped up)."
      },
      "strategies": {
        "header": "Strategies",
        "paragraph1": "A performance fee is charged on profits harvested by strategies. A share of this performance fee is paid to the strategist of the yield-farming strategy employed, while a small part of the fee is kept in a poolâ€™s reserve fund."
      }
    },
    "token": {
      "header": "The Mero governance token",
      "paragraph1": "The Mero governance token distribution is designed to incentive participation among three core protocol stakeholders (liquidity providers, AMM liquidity providers, and Keepers). The majority of the token supply will be distributed to these stakeholders. More information regarding Mero tokenecomics can be found in the <0>docs</0>.",
      "paragraph2": "The Mero governance token is the native ERC-20 token of the Mero protocol. Token holders can lock their tokens to participate in protocol governance. Additionally, locked Mero governance tokens receive a share of the protocol fees or revenue. This share of protocol fees or revenue will be determined by the locking period that the Mero governance token holder selects.",
